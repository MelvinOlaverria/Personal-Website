# Personal Website

#### Melvin Olaverria

## Overview 

This is a personal portfolio/projects website. It includes a homepage, a projects page, a portfolio page, about me page, and finally a contact page. 

## How To Use 

The website is easily accessible through GitHub (https://github.com/MelvinOlaverria/Personal-Website.git) or by GitHub Pages (https://melvinolaverria.github.io/Personal-Website/) as well. Be adviced there might be some rendering issues if GitHub Pages is used. 

## Functionality 

This personal website is very easy to use and navigate. It is mobile friendly, and easy to use. The function of it is to provide users with a glimpse of the work I have done, and am currently doing, in the realms of photography, cinematography and web development. It is a good beginners mix of artistic design, good design fundamentals, as well as easy UI. 

## Technologies Used 

The technologies used in this project were as follows. 

- **HTML** to markup the content as best as possible through semantic tags, as well as great web interlinkage of the pages. 
- **CSS** to style every facet of the content. From background images, linear gradients, grids, flexbox, etc. 
- **JavaScript** for the carousel in the About Me page, to cycle through 3 images at an interval of 3 seconds. 
- **Bootstrap** for a responsive navigation, but also some custom styles were added. 
- **Adobe XD** to create the wireframes. 

## Future Improvements 

There is a lot of room for improvement. In the mark up (html) side, perhaps better organization and use of classes and IDs. In the CSS department more efficient ways to achieve a certain look, and also more fluidity and responsiveness. In the JavaScript side maybe expand on knowledge and add better animations that tie in to the whole UX and UI. Animations that make sense, animations with purpose, not for show. Overall the page would have been better if more meaningful content was added. A homepage that allows you to scroll and get a glipse of my work, as well as call to action buttons placed strategicly to guide the user to more of my work, and contact information.
